When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keep all your work local?

When I want to share it with other people, or have a backup of my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To verify that new changes do not affect my own development work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are done within a repository; clones are copies of repositories and branches are a github concept to allow to clone from someone else's repository directly in github.
