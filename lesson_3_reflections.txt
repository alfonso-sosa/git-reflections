When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keep all your work local?

When I want to share it with other people, or have a backup of my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To verify that new changes do not affect my own development work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are done within a repository; clones are copies of repositories and branches are a github concept to allow to clone from someone else's repository directly in github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

We can revert to that state, or fetch the changes that have been made to it, to incorporate our own.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

With another source control system. Branching and sharing work, or working on an experimental branch by myself would be harder. Adding chanes to the remote master is simpler in tools like SVN, but it's easier for other people to introduce mistakes, since a review of those changes is not enforced.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When I want to experiment with new changes that might break the build. Otherwise, smaller, less risky changes could be done in master.
