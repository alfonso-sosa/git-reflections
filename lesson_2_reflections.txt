What happens when you initialize a repository? 

git makes its own hidden directory and starts tracking the project files

Why do you need to do it?

so git can have a place to store the repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area keeps information about the next commit. It allows us to check all the added and/or modified files.
